# Toy Operating System 

## Using ["Writing a Simple Operating System â€”from Scratch"](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) by Nick Blundell

### Additional Works from [author](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjrLiYrvbpXR37c0HV4PmqA) on youtube

### Requirements:
1. GNU Compiler Toolchain (including make)
2. QEMU (for Emulation of x86_64)
3. Text Editor
4. Nasm Assembler
5. ghex (optional)

A script **req.sh** for installing requirements is provide for Ubuntu/Debian users. Note: "chmod +x" before excuting. 
Makefile is available just "make" to build and "make run" to run on QEMU.

### Hopefully this can be helpful to any one reading the text, that wants something to run

###Note:
- No Comments in the code, may add them later.
- Systems requirements may differ and affect building/running of bootloader+kernel.
- Would love your feedback and questions as I am learning also.
- Grateful to the opensource community and authors for providing helpful information.
- This is an ongoing Toy project and I will be adding to it as time goes on.
